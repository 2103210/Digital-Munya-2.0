    two of his sons, including Hisham II, al-Hakam\u2019s successor. The pyxis was
    created in the caliphal ivory workshops of the palatial city of Madinat al-Zahra,
    which were supervised by Durri al-Saghir.  The inscription on the lid reads:

    billah/ Commander of the Faithful. This is what was ordered to be made for the
