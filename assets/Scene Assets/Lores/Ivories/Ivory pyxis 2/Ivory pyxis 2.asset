  text: "Ivory pyxis with pierced lid made for al- Hakam II, c. 964, probably Madi\u0304nat
    al-Zahra\u0304\u2019 (Victoria and Albert Museum, London)  \r\n\r\n This pyxis
    is one of the two surviving objects commissioned by Al-Hakam II for Subh, the
    other being the aforementioned Madrid pyxis. The inscriptions on the two ivories
    are very similar, and it is likely that they were commissioned as a pair.  The
    openwork carving of the object suggests that it was intended to hold perfumed
    substances. (Anderson, The Islamic Villa in Early Medieval Iberia, 88-90). "
