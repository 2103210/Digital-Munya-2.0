  text: "Ivory casket with bearded and unbearded hunters, c. 966\u201368 (The David
    Collection, Copenhagen)  \r\n\r\n \rDue to the inscription on the casket being
    effaced, its exact date and patron are unknown. However the figural imagery suggests
    a patron or recipient close to the caliph. It is possible that the beardless
    figures represented on the casket represent powerful palace eunuchs, such as
    Durri al-Saghir. (Anderson, The Islamic Villa in Early Medieval Iberia, 95). "
